This document looks at any data garbage points which would be counted as actual images.

Rule for counting as image: OCSVM >= -50,000

Fails:
OCSVM  => SVM
-1453  => 1.0
-19934 => 7.0
-8210  => 7.0
-37313 => 7.0
-13745 => 7.0
-13804 => 7.0
-35613 => 7.0
-25180 => 7.0
-19386 => 7.0
-48655 => 7.0
-3605  => 7.0

Thus, do not add class 7.0 to game, and filter out all images with OCSVM < -50,000. Gives 100% accuracy with well taken
marker images, and allows none of the test garbage images through.
